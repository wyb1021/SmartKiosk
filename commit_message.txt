feat: Re-implement core kiosk features and cart management

Re-implemented the following features after reverting to a previous state:
- Centralized menu data in src/data/menuData.js.
- Implemented global cart state management using Context API (src/context/CartContext.js).
- Added quantity increment/decrement and option selection (size, temperature) in MenuDetailScreen.
- Ensured price variation based on size option in MenuDetailScreen and CartScreen.
- Updated CartScreen UI/UX for better cart management.
